# southbag online banking

A ***deliberately terrible*** 'online banking' website made for Borked, a bad site jam as a satirical version of my banks online banking system. I dont like it that much.

## What's Wrong Here?

This site intentionally has performance nightmares, and UI issues to replicate using a bad corporate website.

## Quick Start
1. No setup required.
2. Default password: `123456`
3. Dark mode has "features"
4. Prepare for popups

## 'Features'
- Hardcoded 'credentials' in plain text
- GET parameters for 'sensitive data'
- Render-blocking scripts
- Super genuine "hacked" warnings
- Anti-accessibility CSS 
- Anti Mobile User CSS
