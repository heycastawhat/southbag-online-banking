# southbag online banking

A ***deliberately terrible*** 'online banking' website made for Borked, a bad site jam as a satirical version of my banks online banking system. I dont like it that much.

## What's Wrong Here?

This site intentionally has security vulnerabilities, performance nightmares, and UX disasters. Do NOT use any of these practices in production!

## Quick Start
1. No setup required!!
2. Default password: `123456`
3. Dark mode has "features"
4. Prepare for popups

## Features
- Hardcoded 'credentials' in plain text
- GET parameters for 'sensitive data'
- Render-blocking scripts
- Super genuine "hacked" warnings
- Anti-accessibility CSS 
- Anti Mobile User CSS
- Real human

## Security Notes
All passwords stored in plain text for "easier debugging"
